video I'm going to show you how to scrape all YouTube comments for multiple videos now I've made a video about this before a basic video you can see the link for that up above but that was limited to 100 comments now we're going to scrape all the comments for this video and all comments for multiple videos now I have the code for this out on GitHub I'll put a link for that down below but let's get into python to get started you need an API key from Google Cloud I've covered that all in the last video so get the API key and just stick it where I have Dev in here the request is exactly the same as our last video we're taking a snippet from comments and we're taking Max results equals 100 which is the most results you can take out and then we're taking the response from that and we are going to break out what we want in terms of items in the comments we want the auto display name published at like count text original and public and this is the new part here so I'm creating an infinite while loop here so while 1 equals 1 and then I'm doing a try accept so so we take the next page token from the original request and then there's a key error gets pulled when there's no next page token so that'll take all the comments that'll come out from a video so this is how we make sure that we get all the comments in here with the next page token so going to get that next page token and then I'm going to do a new request in here which is pretty much the same as the old request the only difference is that there's a next page token at the end which we've just pulled up above then we're going to execute that and we're going to get the exact same items out of that um in a for Loop I'm going to go into how you can add more in here in a second and then finally we're going to put this into a data frame and I'm just taking the day after info out here to show you what's come out of this so we going to run this down here and now we can see we from that video we have 556 comments and the reason why we have 556 is that this doesn't take the comment replies it only takes the top level comments so I'm just looking at the first output of this in my response and this is how you can take out different elements of the response so if you want to add more things to it so the top level is kind e tag ID and snippet and then snippet is a dictionary so you have to go down a level there we have the channel ID we've got the video ID then we have the top level comment which is another dictionary then we have e tag ID in that and snippet and that's the important thing snippet top level comment snippet this has all the juicy details in here the text display it has the author name and a couple of different things about the author that the light count and the date that's was published by and then in the original snippet we've got can reply total reply counting is public so how to break this out into the for Loop I'm taking comment equals item snippet top level comment snippet and out of that I'm taking out the author name publish that and like count I'm also doing public equals snippet is public and I'm just putting that into my response and that is what's going to pull out my stuff in there so just keep in mind there's different levels within the response and you can add these to what comes out in the data frame and so play around with this and see what you get to what I've taken out here is I've taken out the author the updated at the light count the text of the comment which is probably the only thing I'll use and public equals true or false in there so how we can sort this and get the top 10 comments is that we can sour values by lie count ascending equals false and 0 to 10 to just get the top 10 out of here so these are the top 10 comments from this video I can also do a 100 if I want and get the top 100 comments out so how to pull comments for multiple videos we're using the exact same start of the of the import and initialization of of the YouTube client but then we're going to wrap a h function around the request I'm just going to call this get comment and my parameter is video because I want to be able to put in multiple videos in here so all I really changed is that the video is called video the video ID is video which I've put up into this so I'm going to run this this just initializes the function and now to get all the comments from any video it's as simple as DF equals get comment video ID and then we get out the DF and the video ID is in the U L of the YouTube video so this is my comments here but this is exactly the same as before and the beauty of this is I can Loop through a number of different video IDs so I'm starting with a blank data frame I'm going to for I in a number of video IDs I'm going to get the comments with my function and then I'm going to concat those together so the first time it runs it'll create the data frame because data frame is empty and then it'll just add all the other comments on so I've taken four videos here and you can see there's 967 rows the IDE don't go up to 9967 cuz they're IDs from each video but you can see the different videos IDs down here and just to prove it I'm going to run this value count and this will show you how many comments per ID so I hope you find that video useful subscribe to the channel for more videos and I'll see you very soon for another data analytics tutorial\n"]}],"source":["from pytube import YouTube\n","from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi\n","from urllib.parse import urlparse\n","import whisper\n","import os\n","\n","def
